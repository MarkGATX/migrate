## Usage 

To use this application, simply visit the [deployed site](https://migrate-abroad.herokuapp.com/).                

Start a search with a country in mind. Are you curious about the stats of a particular country? Type the name of the country into any search bar and hit search.
<ul>
<li>A new page will show up with tiles displaying a title of the component being measured, the country’s associated rating or ranking for that measurement and a relevant icon.</li>
<li>Clicking on the tile will populate more detailed country information and a graph with historical ratings for the measured component.</li>
<li>There are currently 12 tiles available per country which show how a country ranks on matters like Access to Basic Knowledge, Personal Safety, and Health and Wellness. Click them all or only the ones pertinent to you for a better understanding of the country you might one day call home.</li>
</ul>

Not set on a destination, yet? Use our [Helper](https://migrate-abroad.herokuapp.com/form) to pinpoint a destination.
<ul>
<li>Simply choose what’s most important to you and Migrate's Helper will suggest a country based on your selection. </li>
<li>Click on the country name to see more information about the country.</li>
</ul>

To deploy the application locally run ``npm run develop`` in the terminal from the ``root`` folder.
